The project is written for the EasyPIC Development Board using the Real Pic Simulator as the development and testing platform.
The project is written in C using the MicroC IDE.

The project is a real time interface that displays Analouge inputs from the PIC board/simulation. The program allows the input
values to be stored to EEPROM (up to 3 values). It also allows you to plot a graph based on the current reading of the 
analogue input value for 64 samples.
